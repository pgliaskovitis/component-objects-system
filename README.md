# component-objects-system
Framework for component-based game development

The framework is largely based on the paper "Component Based Object Management" by Bjarne Rene and accompanying source code, as it appeared in Game Programming Gems 5. Unlike the original work however, it has been implemented entirely in Java with a conscious effort to take advantage of the Java type system and runtime environment, expecially with respect to interfaces.
