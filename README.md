# component-objects-system
Framework for component-based game development

The framework is largely based on the paper "Component Based Object Management" by Bjarne Rene and accompanying source code, as it appeared in Game Programming Gems 5. Unlike the original work however, it has been implemented entirely in Java with a conscious effort to take advantage of the Java type system and runtime environment, especially with respect to interfaces.

The framework comes complete with an example game built using its facilities, as in the original work.

Project has been developed with the Eclipse IDE (specifically Galileo) and JRE version 1.6. Relevant project files are provided.
